<p class="mb-3"><b>What is gcpdiag?</b></p>

gcpdiag is a command-line diagnostics tool for GCP customers. It
finds and helps to fix common issues in Google Cloud Platform projects. It is
used to test projects against a wide range of best-practices and common
mistakes, based on the troubleshooting experience of the
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/support" style="color: #c9e7f8">Google Cloud Support</a> team.

gcpdiag works similarly like code testing. The lint command runs a test
suite to detect whether the project is deviating from a list of expected
conditions and creates a report.
